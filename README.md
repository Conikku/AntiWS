# AntiWS
Highly configuarable and modular Anti W+S system for Roblox games

documentation is still a heavy WIP (in the script editor stuff is documented but I want to make a page here with documentation and examples) along with the readme but you can grab the rbxl thats in this repository to use as a example

# ⚠️WARNING⚠️
If you plan on adding a option to let people disable friends of theirs from being punished, make the setting name be called something like "Friends Respect Boundries" and not "Friends Can W+S"
I'd advice NOT modifying the module to let there be a option to let players disable punishment at all as that might be against TOS, i'm still unsure about the friend only toggle but I think it may be allowed
